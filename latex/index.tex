This program uses a restrictive algorithm to compute the F\+FT of an image and to perfrom basic operation of image processing based on the Fourier domain. The program is linked and built using the cmake method. In order to be able to use it, the user must have installed the magick++ library from the Image\+Magick A\+PI. The Cmake\+List.\+txt file is provided with all the source file. The user is invited to comment or uncomment the lines corresponding to the OS on which he is using the program.

All kind of image can be read. If they are in R\+GB format, they are automatically converted to grayscale. The gray levels are defined to start from 0 and go to 255, 0 being black and 255 being white.

Three different types of padding are implemented \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mirror Folding
\item Zero Padding
\item Periodization
\end{DoxyItemize}

Two types of filters are implemented \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Noise removing (Low Pass Filter)
\item Edge Detection (High Pass Filter)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Restriction \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Only grayscale images are treated
\item The input images can only be of size that are multiple of two
\item The padding is always extending the size of the image by two
\item The filters implemented are always centered at the origin. Hence no band cut or band pass can be performed
\end{DoxyItemize}

The user has the following choice when running the main \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The name of the input image on which the operations are going to be carried out.
\item The type of Padding desired
\item The type of Filtering desired
\item The gain of the filter (must be between 0 and 1)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The default output are \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The histogram (contained in the file histogram.\+dat)
\item The filtered image in the file named as desired
\item The Phase and Magnitude of the image after and before filtering (contained in the files magnitude/phase\+\_\+filtered.\+png and magnitude/phase\+\_\+origin.\+png)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note to the professor \+: I have built my project on my mac and everything is compiling fine with cmake. I hope that the note that I have put in the C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt also work on the Linux platform.
